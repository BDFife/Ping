# Table Tennis Trainer

## Overview

This is (currently) a barebones 'brick break' type game that's intended to serve as the seed of a MHDBOS2012 hack. 

## Known Issues

* Missing intro/opening screen
* No score
* Paddle 'english' not implemented
* Bouncing against the side of a brick is not supported
* The same audio asset can't play twice overlapping, it seems. Need to look into this.
